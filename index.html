    <p style="color: rgb(255, 166, 0);">Drawing is a form of visual art that involves creating <i>images, shapes, and patterns on a surface using various tools and techniques. </i> Drawing can be used for <i>artistic expression, communication, design, or entertainment. </i>Drawing can also be a <b>relaxing and enjoyable hobby.</b> There are many tools and techniques for drawing, depending on the style and medium you prefer. Some of the common tools are <i>graphite pencils, ink pens, charcoal, pastels, and crayons. </i>Each tool has its own characteristics and effects, such as <i>smoothness, darkness, texture, and color.</i> </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(208, 226, 43);">Sketching is the practice of drawing a rough outline or rough draft version of a final piece of art. Sketching can be used in preparation for a large piece of art, or to just get an idea of how something will look. Sketching can also help you develop your observation and imagination skills, as well as your sense of proportion and perspective.</p>
